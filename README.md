## Proposal

**Problem Statement**: </br>
Our goal is to predict the trajectories of agents from an autonomous vechicle (AV). Given data which has been generated from sensors located on an autonomous vechicle our system will predict the trajectory of these agents captured by the sensors. The result could then theoretically be used in the decision making process for the AV to take the correct maneuver.</br>
**Approach**: </br>
**Experiments and Results**: </br>
