## Proposal

**Problem Statement**: </br>
Our goal is to predict the trajectories of pedestrains from an autonomous vechicle (AV). Given data which has been generated from sensors located on an autonomous vechicle our system will predict the trajectory of the pedestrains captured by the sensors. The result could then theoretically be used in the decision making process for the AV to either avoid the pedestrain or continue on its path. </br>
**Approach**: </br>
**Experiments and Results**: </br>
